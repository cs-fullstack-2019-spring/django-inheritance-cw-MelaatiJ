<h1>AFTER SCHOOL + WEEKEND PROGRAMS</h1>
<h3>During the school year, CodeCrew teaches kids to use Scratch, build Android apps, practice JavaScript coding and learn Unity game development. These programs meet weekly.  Kids show off their acquired skills in our December and May Hour of Code events.</h3>

<h1>WHAT WE'RE DOING</h1>
<h3>We are changing Memphis with programs that focus on ensuring that students are taught the principles of information and computation, how digital systems work, and they learn how to put this knowledge to use through programming and software development concepts. CodeCrew programming includes a number of summer camps, after school programs, in-school electives classes, internships and special events.
    ​
    Since May 2015, we have taught more than 1,000 students to code through our summer camps, after school programs, in-school electives, and special events. Of the 250 kids we serve weekly, 91% are black and latinx youth, 41% are girls who code, and overall, 89% of our students are more likely to study computer science.
