Recreate the CodeCrew website with the a home page (make it the CodeCrew logo clickable), About Us, Gallery with 4 pictures, Resources and Contact Us.

The home page, about us, and resources page should have some of the same information as the original site.

The gallery only needs to have 4 pictures.

The contact page should have name and email. A secret page should be accessible to see all the contact's names and email addresses.

All pages should have the navigation bar at the top. There should be a sidebar area for every page except for the comments page. Put CodeCrew's current footer in that area.
<hr>
1 point. The secret page should be secret. It shouldn't go direct to it after a post is made. Also, I can't view the contents of the entries on the secret page. And there is not sidebar.
